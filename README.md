# Django_dailyfresh_project

## Project introduction
Based on Itheima Django course projects. Dailyfresh is a B2C e-commerce website project built with the Django framework. This project is built for the purpose of learning the features of Django. The project mainly includes four important aspects: user, goods, shopping cart and order. The functions of those aspects cover some of the basic needs of an e-commerce website.

### The main tech stacksï¼š
1. Python, Django  
2. Mysql: store the data of users, goods, and orders
3. Redis: implement shopping cart's functions, store users' browser history, and work as a message broker for Celery
4. Celery: send the activation email to a user in an asynchronous way when that user registers
5. FastDFS & Nginx: store images of the website in a distributed way; convenient to scale the storage; increase the efficiency to get images
6. Haystack & Whoosh: search framework and search engine; used for the search purposes inside the website
